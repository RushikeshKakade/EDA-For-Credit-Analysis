# EDA-For-Credit-Analysis

# Problem Statement: 

- Understand how the bank approves and refuses loan. Find out different patterns and represent the outcomes to help the bank reduce the credit risk and interest risk.  The two input files are extracted, cleaned/transformed and few columns are analyzed via different charts generated using different Python libraries. Then some inferences are made based on the outcomes.
